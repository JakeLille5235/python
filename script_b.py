# assignment 2 for week 1
# take age from input, print future age in 10 years

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
futureAge = int(age) + 10
print("Hello " + name + ", in 10 years you will be " + str(futureAge) + " years old.")

# pretty basic, but learned input, string concatenation, type conversion
